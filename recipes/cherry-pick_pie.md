# Cherry-Pick Pie

## Crust

Feel free to get one from the store.  However, if you you want to make your own graham cracker crust...

- 1 package of graham crackers, plus a sheet or two
- 3 Tb oil
- ≈ 3 Tb water
- salt

Smash up the graham crackers with great vehemence, then mix them together with the rest of the ingredients.

Squish into a pie crust and bake at 375˚F for 10 minutes.

- 2/3 c sugar
- 1/4 c corn starch
- 1 1/2 c water

In saucepan, stir above together and turn up the heat!

- 4 c tart cherries
- a bunch of lemon juice because you can't have too much

Add everything else in and bring to a boil while stirring.  

After it has thickened, pour the filling into your crust and pop in the oven at 400˚F for 10 or 15 minutes.
