# Git Day

July 21st is Git Day!

Once a year, we set aside a day for celebrating the version control that makes our lives more joyful.

## What do you do on Git Day?

Some activities are fun to do with your friends:

- 🍒 Eat git themed food with a fork, obviously
- 🖍️ Decorate an octocat
- 🧑‍🏫 Teach someone how to use git!

You can also celebrate Git Day from the comfort of your own home:

- 🍴 Work on that project that you've had your eye on
- 🙏 Thank your favorite repo maintainers!
- 😊 Rename a default branch to `main`
- ❌ `find . -name .svn -exec rm -rf {} \;`
  - Just kidding, version control of any kind rocks. We respect and salute our SVN friends!

## What do you eat on Git Day?

Honestly, with enough creativity you can probably make a case for any food you want being part of a Git Day feast. We recommend going for puns where possible, with traditional Git Day fare such as `cherry-pick pie` and `pulled pork`. Most foods can be `bisected` or `rebased` with a little work. Of course, you could always fall back on an old classic and `git fetch` some `prunes`.

Need some inspiration?  Check out our [recipes](/recipes/README.md)!

If you think up a good food for your own party, then you have a wonderful Git Day opportunity! Fork this repository, add your idea, and open a pull request so that we can keep the version control party rolling!

## Why is Git Day July 21st?

First, we substituted numbers for each of the letters in git.

```
G = 7
I = 9
T = 20
```

(Note: this is one-indexed due to domain specific conventions in alphanumeric-cyphers common in childhood toys and super secret spy correspondence.  Also because we're an XSLT/XPath shop. Also because it would be very confusing if the 7th month of the year was August).

The 7 lends itself well to `"July"`, but since `920` does not fall within the range `1` - `31` we had to get creative.

```python
920 % 31
  => 21
```

And so it was that July 21st became the home of this most majestic of holidays.
