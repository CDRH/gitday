# Git Day

July 21st is Git Day!

Once a year, we set aside a day for celebrating the version control that makes our lives more joyful.

## What do you do on Git Day?

- Eat git themed food with a fork, obviously
- `find . -name .svn -exec rm -rf {} \;` `*`
- Fork that project that you always wanted to work on
- Thank your favorite repo maintainers
- Decorate an octocat

`*` Just kidding, version control of any kind rocks, and we respect and salute our SVN friends!

## What makes a food git themed?  Besides that you eat it with a fork...

Well, you're definitely going to need some puns, that's for sure.  Cherry-pick pie and pulled pork being two of the very best.  Of course, you could always just go with some git fetch prunes if you're not feeling fancy.

## Why is Git Day July 21st?

First, we substituted numbers for each of the letters in git.  (Note: this is one-indexed due to domain specific conventions in alphanumeric-cyphers common in childhood toys and super secret spy correspondence.  Also because we're an XSLT/XPath shop)

```
G = 7
I = 9
T = 20
```

The 7 lends itself well to `"July"`, but since `920` does not fall within the range `1` - `31` we had to get creative.

```python
920 % 31
  => 21
```
